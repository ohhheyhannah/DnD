<p>[Open] can read many forms of files. When a file is opened, excluding the original form of MQO file, the following dialogues 
are shown and you can adjust the size and the direction of an axis. More options are added in some forms. See
<a href="../import.htm">Import</a> for attention matters for each form. </p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top"><img border="0" height="426" src="open.png" width="201" /></td>
		<td valign="top">
		<p><b>Size</b><br />
		Scaling rate is set to 1.0 of the original size at default setting. If you click 'auto adjust', scaling rate is 
		adjusted to 100. <br />
		You can change the size or the unit by using 'digit'. For example,'5.000 x -2 digit' makes 0.05 times the size and 
		'0.200 x 4 digit' makes 2000 times the size. Some softwares use the units of mm or km and you can convert them to 
		the appropriate unit by changing sets of 3 figures. As each software has its own conversion ratio, please check 
		the result by yourself.<br />
		<a href="../config.htm">Configuration</a> can change scaling rate.</p>
		<p><b>Axis</b><br />
		As the direction of x/y/z axes is different in each software, it can make it to the same direction by appearance. 
		Some data are already provided, but please change to the appropriate data by using 6 buttons if you cannot find 
		applicable ones.<br />
		And if the direction of face is reversed after opening, please change to the appropriate check by reading the file 
		again.</p>
