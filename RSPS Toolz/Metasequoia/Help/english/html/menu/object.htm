<h2>Object</h2>
<p>It works for the currently selected 
object.(You can select the current object on <a href="../objpanel.htm">Object 
Panel</a>.)<br />
<br />
</p>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>Create - Landscape<font color="#ff0000" size="2"> (only shareware 
	version)</font></h3>
	<p>It creates the rough mesh of landscape from an image file or fractal image.</p>
	<div class="menuimage">
		<img height="164" src="landscape.gif" width="239" />
	</div>
</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>Create - Create text (Plug-in)<font color="#ff0000" size="2">(only 
	shareware version)</font></h3>
	<p>It creates strings using TrueType font.</p>
</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>Freeze</h3>
	<p>It entirely polygonizes the current object on which the patch or mirror is applied.</p>
	<div class="menuimage">
		<img height="161" src="../image/freeze.png" width="324" />
	</div>
</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>Shift the position</h3>
	<p>It arranges the current object at the position which is designated by the 
	direction of each axis.</p>
</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>Join closed vertices</h3>
	<p>It joins the closed vertices in the same object.<br />
	It is mainly used to join vertices which seem to be close by appearance but 
	they really are separated.</p>
</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>Reduce polygons</h3>
	<p>It reduces the vertices of the current object without changing appearance.</p>
	<p>In this version, the result is not so nice and UV coordination is not kept. 
	All faces become triangles.</p>
	<p>Though the using availability is limited because the accuracy is not high, 
	you had better reduce the number of vertices by 10 to 20 percent for finer 
	finish after the polygonization of blobs.</p>
	<div class="menuimage">
		<img height="139" src="reduction.png" width="340" />
	</div>
</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>Mesh smoothing<font color="#ff0000" size="2"> (only shareware version)</font></h3>
	<p>It smoothes faces by increasing the number of faces. </p>
	<p>It sometimes becomes roughly as more improvement is needed in this version.</p>
</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>Align faces</h3>
	<p>It aligns the direction of faces of the current object. But, whether they 
	turn to the inside or the outside is not fixed, you may need to use <b>[Invert]</b>. 
	And you cannot unify them well without closing all faces to one perfectly.</p>
	<p>It is especially effective when a DXF or ROK file is read.</p>
</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>Delete overlapped faces</h3>
	<p>It deletes one of the faces in case two faces are located on the same 
	position in the current object.</p>
</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>Unify faces</h3>
	<p>It deletes one side of faces which have both front and back sides in the 
	current object. As which side will be deleted is unknown, you may need to 
	use <b>[Align faces]</b>.</p>
	<p>Nothing is done with a double-sided face by the material property because there is one face only.</p>
</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>Attach current material to non-material faces</h3>
	<p>It attaches the current material to the non-material faces in the current 
	object.</p>
</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>Wired (Plug-in) <font color="#ff0000" size="2">(only shareware version)</font></h3>
	<p>It makes all edges of faces to lines and deletes faces.</p>
	<p>This may not be practical yet as this is only sample Plug-in. </p>
</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>Delete lines (Plug-in) <font color="#ff0000" size="2">(only shareware version)</font></h3>
	<p>It deletes all lines in the object.</p>
</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>Boolean (Plug-in) <font color="#ff0000" size="2">(only shareware version)</font></h3>
	<p>It picks out or makes up the only overlapping part of two objects using 
	boolean operation. Please refer to Help in Plug-in for further details.
	</p>
	<p>This Plug-in is developed by <a href="http://bomber.xps.jp/" target="_blank">
	Mr.Bomber</a>, and thanks his kindness.</p>
</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>Anguwrap (Plug-in) <font color="#ff0000" size="2">(only shareware version)</font></h3>
	<p>It generates an unwrapped UV mapping so that the selected lines become borders.</p>
	<p>UV unwrapping is applied for all faces in the current object. And UV unwrapping will be failed when no line is selected.</p>
