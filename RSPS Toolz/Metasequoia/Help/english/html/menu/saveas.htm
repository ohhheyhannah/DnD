<p>[Save As] can read many forms of files. When a files is saved in the form excluding the original form of MQO, the following 
dialogues are shown and you can adjust the size and the direction of an axis. More options are added in some formats. See
<a href="../export.htm">Import</a> for attention matters for each format.</p>
<table>
	<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top"><img border="0" height="359" src="saveas.png" width="385" /></td>
		<td valign="top">
		<p><b>Size</b><br />You can make a large scaling in size and unit with 'digit'. For example, '5.000 x -2 digit' makes 
		0.05 times and '0.200 x 4 digit' makes 2000 times. Some softwares use mm or km and you can convert them to the appropriate 
		unit by changing sets of 3 figures. As each software has its own conversion ratio, please check the result by yourself.<br />
		</p>
		<p><b>Axis</b><br />As the direction of x/y/z axes is different in each software, it can make it to the same direction 
		by appearance with using this. Some data are already provided, but please change to the appropriate data by using 
		6 buttons if you cannot find applicable ones. <br />And if the right and left or the direction of face is reversed, 
		please change to the appropriate check by saving the file again.<br /></p>
