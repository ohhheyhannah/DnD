<h2>How to make faces</h2>
<p>Modeling starts with making faces. There are some ways to make faces and I will introduce them to you here.</p>
<img height="386" src="face.png" width="128" style="float:left" />
<div style="margin-left:145px">
<div class="menu">
	<h3>1. <a href="../command/create.htm">[Create] command</a></h3>
	<p>Click four times on the 3D view, and a new face is created. Or, click three times and click a right button, and a 
	new triangle is created.</p>
	<p>When you click near the existing vertex, a vertex of the new face is shared with the existing face. It is 
	certain to share vertices while pressing the Ctrl key.</p>
</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>2. <a href="../command/pullface.htm">[Pull] command</a></h3>
	<p>[Create] command requires four clicks, and it's a little troublesome. When a face has already existed, select a line and drag it 
	in <b>[Pull] command</b>. It is very easy to make a face that contains first selected line.</p>
</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>3. <a href="../command/wire.htm">[Wire] command</a></h3>
	<p>[Pull] 
	command makes a quadrangle, and <b>[Create a triangle]</b> in <b>[Wire] command</b> makes a triangle. Select a line 
	and drag it, and it makes a new triangle that contains first selected line.</p>
</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>4. <a href="../command/primitive.htm">[Primitive] command</a></h3>
	<p>You can make a basic shape like a cube, a sphere, a 
	cylinder and so on by [Primitive] command.</p>
</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>5. <a href="../command/metaball.htm">[Blob] command</a></h3>
	<p>You can create smooth faces like pulling against each other when you use&nbsp; <b>
	[Blobs] command</b>.</p>
	<p>You must <b>polygonize</b> them after putting blobs.</p>
	<div class="menuimage"><img height="164" src="face4.gif" width="277" /></div>
</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>6. Patches</h3>
	<p>It can make smooth patches from polygons for 
	realtime. (<font color="#C00000">Faces must be quadrangles fundamentally</font> except Catmull-Clark.)</p>
	<p>Select the <b>menu - [Panel] - [Object Panel]</b> and push a 'Property] button. A setting dialog is shown, so 
	select 'Spline Type1/2' or 'Catmull-Clark' in 'Patch' group, and push a OK button. Polygon are displayed as smooth 
	patches. It is possible to operate as before, you can edit an object easily.</p>
	<p>If you want to convert patches to polygons, select <b>menu - [Object] - [Freeze]</b> and freeze them with 
	checking a 'Patch'.</p>
