<h2>Patches</h2>
<p>You can make smooth patches from rough polygons automatically by setting a patch in the property of the
<a href="objpanel.htm">object panel</a>. There are three types of a patch in this version.</p>
<p>When you use [Spline Type 1] and [Spline Type 2], polygons must be <span class="red">quadrangles only</span> as a general 
rule. A triangle can be mixed, but it must be <span class="red">surrounded by three quadrangles</span>. A hole opens 
if the neighboring face of a triangle is triangle or there is no face next to it. As two triangles can be connected each 
other, you can combine them into one quadrangle.</p>
<p>[Catmull-Clark] can make patches from both triangles and quadrangles. It becomes quite rounded compared to the former 2 
types. It displays a little slower than other types, and <span class="red">wait is neglected</span>.</p>

<p>When you want to convert patches to polygons, select <b>menu - Object - Freeze</b>. Patches are mostly frozen automatically 
when you save a file except MQO format.<br />
