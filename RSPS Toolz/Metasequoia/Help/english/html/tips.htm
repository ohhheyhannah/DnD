		<li>You can switch parallel projection and perspective projection with F4 key.</li>
		<li>You can record the current viewpoint and edit option when you press F5-8 keys with pressing the Shift key and 
		go back to the recorded data when you press F5-8 keys without pressing the Shift key. </li>
		<li>If you press the S key as shortcut when the [Select] command is selected, the behavior of option changes. You

		<li>In the standard mode, the viewpoint rotates when you press the right button on 3D picture, but you can zoom 
		the viewpoint when you press the left button with pressing the right button.</li>
		<li>When you press [Pt], [Ln], and [Fc] buttons in edit option or view option at the top of 3D picture with a click 
		on the right side, you can switch it in order.</li>
		<li>If you click [Si] in view option on the top of 3D picture with pressing the right side of the mouse, you can 
		select ON/OFF of simplified display of patch, mirror, lathe, and blob.</li>
		<li>When you click the right side of the mouse with moving 1 vertex in [Move] command, you can join it with the

		<li>Remove the checks of [Show precisely], [Show textures], and [Smoothing] if they are unnecessary.</li>
		<li>Widen the lattice intervals of blobs.</li>
		<li>Check which of Direct3D and OpenGL works faster or which property makes faster display like those in [Benchmark].</li>
