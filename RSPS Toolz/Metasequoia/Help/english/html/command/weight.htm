<h2>Weight</h2>
<p>A weight for a vertex or a crease for an edge makes a non-round object applying a patch.</p>
<p>A weight is only available for '<b>Spline type 1</b>' or '<b>Spline type 2</b>' patches. Weight can be set from -1.0 to 1.0. 
When you drag a mouse on the selected face, you can see the change of the shape in real time.</p>
