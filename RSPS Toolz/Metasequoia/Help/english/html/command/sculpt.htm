<p>
[Sculpt] command provides an edit function like a painting software by heaping a 
surface up or inflating for the dragged part.</p>
  <p>This command supports a pen tablet(*) that has a perception of a pressure. 
  You can edit in detail with a pen tablet.</p>
  <p>(*) It is required to support Wintab. Tablet PC is not supported.</p>
</div>
<div style="clear:both; visibility:hidden;"></div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>Draw</h3>
	<p>It arranges vertices so that they are heaped up or down with dividing 
	polygons along with the trajectory by dragging.</p>
	<p>You can specify whether to heap up or down by the [Reverse] check.</p>

</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>Smooth</h3>
	<p>It moves vertices so that the surface become smooth.</p>
</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>Inflate</h3>
	<p>It generates polygons and arranges vertices so that the dragged part will 
	be gradually grown in the front direction of the viewpoint.</p>
	<p>It heaps up gradually if the pressure is weak. If the pressure is strong, 
	you trace the grown part in detail and you can generate an object like a 
	horn.</p>

</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>Flatten</h3>
	<p>It moves vertices so that the surface become flat.</p>
</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>Grab</h3>
	<p>It moves vertices so that the dragged part is pulled.</p>
	<p>
	When [Auto subdivision] is unchecked, it will be almost same as [Magnet] 
	command. When [Auto subdivision] is checked, an extend line will be divided 
	and an area of each face will be adjusted so that it become to some extent 
	uniform.</p>
</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>Brush size</h3>
	<p>It specifies the range for a creation of polygons and a movement of 
	vertices.</p>
	<p>This size is a relative value to the zoom rate in the view. The actual 
	influenced range will be changed by a zoom or a dolly.</p>
</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>Pressure</h3>
	<p>It influences to the movement moment of vertices by dragging.</p>
</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>Auto subdivision</h3>
	<p>It specifies whether to move vertices with subdividing polygons 
	automatically when you operate with this command.</p>
	<p>
	When the automatic subdivision is enabled, you can draw in detail without caring 
	about the roughness of the original 
	polygons. But the number of vertices and one of faces are increased rapidly. 
	When the automatic subdivision is disabled, this command only moves vertices 
	and the number is not changed , but it is difficult to draw in detail.</p>
	<p>In this version, long and slender polygons are often generated near the 
	boundary of the circle of the brush after subdividing polygons, and they 
	will make wrinkes.</p>

</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>Subdivision level</h3>
	<p>It specifies the level of the subdivision when the automatic subdivision 
	is enabled. If the knob of a slider is moved to the left, faces will be 
	divided in detail. And if it is moved to the right, they will be divided 
	roughly.</p>
