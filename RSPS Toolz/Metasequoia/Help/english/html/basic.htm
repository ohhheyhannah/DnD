<h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>Coordinate axes</h3>
	<img height="80" src="image/name3.gif" width="80" style="float:right" />
	<div style="margin-right:90px">
	<p>Metasequoia's 3D coordinate axis 
		is organized as in the diagram on the right. It is a right-handed coordinate system. X is horizontal, 
		Y is vertical, and Z is into and out of the screen. Notice the color coding: X is red, Y is green, and Z is blue.</p>
	</div>
	<div style="clear:both; visibility:hidden"></div>
</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>Document model</h3>
	<p>A Metasequoia document contains objects and materials.</p>
	<p>It is necessary to run multiple copies of Metasequoia if you want to edit more than 
		one Metasequoia document at once. You can use the Cut, Copy, and Past commands to exchange data between the 
	different documents when you run two or more copies of the same version of Metasequoia.</p>
</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>Objects</h3>
	<img height="116" src="image/name2.png" width="136" style="float:right" />
	<div style="margin-right:146px">
	<p>One document can contain two 
		or more objects. <a href="objpanel.htm">Object panel</a> You can use the object panel to perform &quot;layer&quot;-like 
		operations, where some parts of your document are visible, but inactive, while other parts can be freely edited.</p>
	<p>Objects are made up of three parts: vertices, edges, and faces. (Abbreviated V, E, and F.) 
	Only front side of faces are displayed, and <font color="#ff0000">back side of faces are not visible.</font> Only triangles and quads are allowed. <font color="#ff0000">
	Polygons with more than four edges are not allowed.</font></p>
	</div>
	<div style="clear:both; visibility:hidden"></div>
</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>Materials</h3>
	<p>Each face can be assigned a material, and the same material can be assigned to many faces. The
		<a href="matpanel.htm">Material Property Panel</a> can be used to edit a material's properties (such as its color 
		or texture). Any faces that don't have a material assigned to them automatically get a default material.</p>
</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>Texture mapping and UV coordinates</h3>
	<p>Texture mapping is used to add realism and/or details to your models. UV coordinates are used to control which 
		part of a texture is mapped to a face. Metasequoia contains several commands which allow you to edit the UV 
	coordinates 
		of an object's faces.
		<p>Texture maps can be specified using the <a href="matpanel.htm">Material Property Panel</a>. The texture's data can 
		be edited by using the <a href="painter.htm">Paint Panel</a>. In addition, you can edit the texture by drawing directly 
		on the 3D object in the 3D window, by using the Paint command.<br />

	<h3>World / Screen / Local Coordinates</h3>	
	<img src="image/wsoption.png" width="129" height="107" style="float:right"/>
	<div style="margin-right:142px">
	<p>With some commands, such as the &quot;Move&quot; 
	command, you can choose which coordinate system to use to perform the command. You can switch between 
	coordinate systems by pressing the &quot;W&quot; and &quot;S&quot; buttons in the &quot;Edit Option&quot; panel.</p>
	<p>You can edit along axes displayed at the base point in world coordinates, and you can edit horizontally or 
	vertically 
	on the screen in screen coordinates. Local coordinate is assigned to each object, and you can edit along the axes in 
	local coordinates by [Move] command and so on after setting the local coordinates by [Local] command.</p>
