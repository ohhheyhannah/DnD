<h2>Object Panel</h2>
<p>&quot;Object Panel&quot; controls objects.
You can select ON or OFF with <b>menu [Panel] [Object Panel]</b>.</p>
<p>When you move the mouse to the right edge of the main window dragging the title, it will be joined to the main window. But 
you can make it independent if do this together with pressing the Ctrl key.</p>

<div style="margin-left:146px">
<p>Color is shown with highlight in the Current object. (&quot;obj1&quot; is the current object in the left picture.)</p>
<p>When you click the name of the object pressing a keyboard, the following operation is performed.</p>
<table class="menutable">
	<tr>
		<td class="tableheader">Ctrl</td>
		<td bgcolor="#ffffff">It selects or deselects on the list.</td>

<h3>Object Property</h3>
<p><img height="488" src="image/objprop.png" width="544" /></p>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>Object's name</h3>
	<p>It sets up the name, color, visibility, and the possibility of the editing.</p>
	<p>The color selected in Configuration is applied when a cross mark is put on the colored section and the color selected here 
		is applied when a cross mark is not shown. If you <font color="#ff0000">click the right side </font>when a cross 
	mark is not shown, it 
		is put again.</p>
</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>Patch</h3>
	<p>It selects how to control faces of objects. Objects selected as patch can be changed to their patch into normal 
		plane by <b>menu [Object] [Freeze]</b>.</p>
		<img height="180" src="image/patch0.gif" width="223" style="float:left"/>

		It shows normal planes. It can be used for both triangles and quadrangles.

		<b>Patch type 1</b><br />
	Basically, patch is applied to only quadrangles. It is applied to only triangles whose three sides are surrounded by 
		quadrangles.<br />
		The edge of the unclosed patch is located away form vertices and lines. It becomes exactly same as &quot;Patch type 
		2&quot; for a complete closed patch.</p>

		Basically, patch is applied to only quadrangles. It is applied to only triangles whose three sides are surrounded 
		by quadrangles.<br />
		The edge of the unclosed patch is located near vertices and lines. It becomes exactly same as &quot;Patch type 1&quot;

		<b>Catmull-Clark</b><br />
		It can be applied to both triangles and quadrangles.<br>
		When the [Reserve triangles] is ON, triangles in the original object will be subdividied into multiple triangles. Subdividing with reversing triangles can make a smooth patch around the border between a triangle and a quadrangle.<br />
		A Catmull-Clark subdivision makes different patches from Patch type 1 or 2. But it may give the same shape in other software because a Catmull-Clark subdivision has a compatibility with many other software that supports a Catmull-Clark subdivision.<br />
		(Caution: Please confirm a compatibility with an other software because some software make different patches from Metasequoia, and creased edges or open edges also make different patches.)</p>

	<h3>Mirroring</h3>

	<p><b>In [Separated]</b>, the copied face is created on the other side and each face is treated individually.</p>
	<p><b>In [Joined]</b>, in addition to the face created on the other side, the face which can connect to the original 
	face is created. When you put a limit on the joining distance, the face connecting both sides of the faces is not 
	created if the faces are located in farther than the selected distance from the symmetrical boundary (XZ plane, 
	when you make the mirror in the direction of X axis, for example). </p>
