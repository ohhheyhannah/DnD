<h2>Change of hardware accelerator</h2>
<p>When you open [Screen] in the control panel, the following screen is shown. (The 
screen is somewhat different according to version of OS or video card.)</p>
<div class="menuimage">
<img height="416" src="screen.gif" width="469" />
</div>
<p>Click &quot;Detail&quot; in &quot;Property&quot; in &quot;Screen Property&quot; 
and the following screen is shown. (The screen is somewhat different according to 
version of OS or video card.)<br />

<p>You can disable hardware accelaration of Direct3D ineffective by moving the slider 
of &quot;Hardware accelerator&quot; in the &quot;Trouble shootings&quot; towards &quot;None&quot;. 
It seems to disable OpenGL at the same time though it is not clearly stated.</p>
