	<h3>Q1. It is difficult to select vertices or lines.</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt>A1. The distance to select is small.</dt>
		<dd>When you use the high resolving power, it sometimes be difficult to select vertices or lines. Increase the value 
		of [Distance to select] in Configuration. </dd>

	<h3>Q2. I cannot select vertices, lines, or faces with a click.</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt>A2-1. Objects are prohibited to select.</dt>
		<dd>If there is a key mark on the left side of the name column on object panel, that object is prohibited to edit. 
		Click the key mark or remove the check of prohibiting edit in Object Property. </dd>
		<dt>A2-2. [Sel Lock] mode is selected.</dt>
		<dd>When [Sel Lock] is highlighted on the right side of the status bar, you cannot release selection. Switch ON and OFF

	<h3>Q3. Shape of the object is broken in symmetric editing.</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt>A3-1. A pair of the vertices does not exist.</dt>
		<dd>A pair of the vertices is always necessary for a symmetric editing. A vertex without a pair is moved to X=0 
		and is fixed at the position if you set [Fix X=0] for [Move non-symmetry vertex] in Configuration, and it 
		helps you to arrange it the symmetric center.</dd>
		<dt>A3-2. Command is not available with symmetric editing.</dt>
		<dd>All commands are not available with symmetric editing. Please confirm which command is available with the 
		symmetric editing.</dd>

	<h3>Q4. The area close to or remote from the viewpoint is not shown or shown in twisted shape.</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt>A4-1. The problem of parameters of a camera</dt>
		<dd>Twist caused by perspective occurs when 3D space objects are projected into 2D plane. If the distance from the 
		camera to the target object becomes shorter in bigger view angle, twist seems to be conspicuous. So, change perspective 
		and view angle in [View] command or select initialization in menu [View] [Set View].</dd>
		<dt>A4-2. Use dolly</dt>
		<dd>Assign [Dolly] for such as Wheel in Configuration. When you enlarge or reduce view, field of view is not 
		changed 
		and the distance from the view point changes in dolly.</dd>

		<dd>Select a vertex, a line, or a face near the position you want to make it center and select menu [Selected] [Set 
		center of rotation (Ctrl+W). Then you can make that position to the center of the rotation of the viewpoint. And 
		if you also select menu [Selected] [Fit to view] (Ctrl+F), it becomes convenient because the screen fits to the selected
