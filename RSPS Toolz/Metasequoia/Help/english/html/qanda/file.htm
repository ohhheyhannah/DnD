	<h3>Q1. Objects created in other software cannot be read well in Metasequoia or objects created in Metasequoia cannot be read in other 
	software.</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt>A1-1. Use of inapplicable function</dt>
		<dd>Confirm the applicable function for <a href="..\import.htm">Import file</a> or <a href="..\export.htm">Export file</a>. 
		Keep in mind that some data are lost in most cases when forms excluding MQO are used.</dd>
		<dt>A1-2. The problem of software version</dt>
		<dd>As file forms are somewhat different in each software version, objects cannot sometimes be loaded well. Please try these things: do not use new or old version or use the different file form. But notice that any measure sometimes cannot solve the problem.</dd>

	<h3>Q2. The front and back of faces become irregular when objects created in other software are read.</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt>A2. The direction of faces is not defined in file.</dt>
		<dd>As some software or file formats regard faces as double-faced without the front and back, they export files in irregular direction. In that case, correct the front and back of faces with 
		<ul>
			<li>menu [Object] [Align faces]</li>
			<li>[Invert] command</li>
		</ul>
		Especially, it often becomes irregular when you load DXF or ROK.

	<h3>Q3. The texturing are lost when I load in other software.</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt>A3-1. Use of inapplicable image format</dt>
		<dd>If the image format (such as BMP, JPG) used by the texture is not supported the other software, the file 
		will be ignored and a texture will be not shown when importing the software. Please confirm which image format 
		is supported in the other software before importing files.</dd>
		<dt>A3-2. Export in the form without UV mapping information</dt>
  		<dd>Some file forms cannot have UV mapping information. Use other forms in this case. See <a href="..\export.htm">Export file</a> to check availability of UV mapping with each form.</dd>
		<dt>A3-3. Form inapplicable to texture</dt>
		<dd>Some file forms like DXF are not applicable to texture. Use other forms.</dd>

	<h3>Q4. The number of vertices increases or directions of faces become irregular when exported file is read in other 
	software.</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt>A4. Because of normal of UV mapping method</dt>
		<dd>In some forms, the number of vertices increases or 
  faces become irregular when you export with a check in [UV mapping]. Do not check [UV mapping] if it is not necessary.</dd>

	<h3>Q5. Objects becomes very large or small when exporting or importing</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt>A5. The unit of the length is different</dt>
		<dd>Each coordinate of the vertex is just a numeric value without a unit such as meter or millimeter in 
		Metasequoia. When exporting to the other software or importing from the other software, the vertex is done with 
		some unit and it may make large or small objects. You can convert the proper length with specifying [Scaling] 
		factor at the time of exporting or importing. Please confirm how scaling is proper for the scaling.</dd>

	<h3>Q6. I want to know the MQO file format</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt>A6. It is open to the public on the web site.</dt>
		<dd>See the latest file format specification on the web site. And a plug-in SDK contains a source code for 
		reading a MQO file.</dd>
