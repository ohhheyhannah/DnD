<h2>FAQ - Preview</h2>
<p>In preview by Direct3D or OpenGL, many problems arise caused by like a bug or 
compatibility of the video card driver. As reported problems are also mentioned 
on the home page, please see them together with the following points.</p>
<p>It is recommend to obtain the latest driver from the maker of video cards or chips 
and use it to avoid problems. </p>

	<h3>Q1. I cannot use Direct3D preview at all.</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt>A1-1. DirectX 9.0 runtime has not been installed</dt>
		<dd>Please get and install DirectX 9 or later from the Microsoft DirectX 
		site it if you use WindowsXP(no SP or SP1).</dd>
		<dt>A1-2. Unsupport hardware rendering</dt>
		<dd>Some old PCs do not support a hardware rendering. And some 
		virtual environments like as VirtualPC or remote desktop do not support Direct3D. Please 
		us other view mode in these cases because the Direct3D display mode is 
		not supported.</dd>
		<dt>A1-3. Bugs of the display driver</dt>
		<dd>Please get and install the latest display driver.</dd>

	<h3>Q2. I cannot use OpenGL preview at all</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt>A2-1. Bugs of the display driver</dt>
		<dd>Please get and install the latest display driver. If you still cannot solve the problem, reduce the level of hardware 
		accelerator and switch off the accelerator of OpenGL. (<a href="accelerator.htm">How 
		to change accelerator</a>)</dd>

		<dt>A3-2. Problem for hardware</dt>
		<dd>It may be caused by problem for the hardware such as physical 
		failure, thermal runaway, and so on.</dd>

	<h3>Q4. Texture is not shown</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt>A4-1. Video memory is insufficient.</dt>
		<dd>As video memory (VRAM) is limited in Direct3D or OpenGL mode, it cannot 
		be shown when available capacity becomes insufficient.<br />
		You can take measures like:
		<ul>
			<li>Make the size of the picture for texture smaller. </li>
			<li>Reduce the resolution or the number of colors of the picture.
			</li>
			<li>Change to the video card with more video memory. </li>
			<li>Reduce the value in [Max resolution of texture] in [Preview] page 
			of menu [File] [Configuration]. </li>
		</ul>
		But the setting itself of mapping image is effective even if it is not shown, 
		so you do not have to worry about that according to the situation. </dd>
		<dt>A4-2. Image file for texture is not put in the appropriate folder.</dt>
		<dd>You need to put image folder in the folder selected in [Folder of mapping 
		bitmaps] in menu [File] [Configuration].</dd>
		<dt>A4-3. [Texture] is not checked.</dt>
		<dd>Texture is not shown if there is not a check in menu [View] [Texture].</dd>
		<dt>A4-4. Bugs of the display driver</dt>
		<dd>Same as A1-3.</dd>

	<h3>Q6. Overlapped semi-transparent polygon is not shown correctly.</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt>A6. It's a specification</dt>
		<dd>As data processing cost becomes very large in order to show front and 
		back of 
		semi-transparent polygon. Semi-transparent polygon is not always shown 
		correctly because high speed is regarded as more important even if it is 
		incorrect. You can make more accurate the following: <br />
		<ul>
			<li>Separate semi-transparent polygon into another object</li>
			<li>Replace the object at the back with the forward in object panel</li>
		</ul>
