		<dd>Assign UV value in [UVedit] command or select other formats except UV in [Mapping] command or Material Property.</dd>

	<h3>Q2. I select alpha mapping in Material Property, but it does not work on 3D screen.</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt>A2-1. Video memory is insufficient.</dt>
		<dd>As video memory (VRAM) is limited in Direct3D or OpenGL mode, it cannot 
		be shown when available capacity becomes insufficient.<br />
		You can take measures like:
		<ul>
			<li>Make the size of the picture for texture smaller. </li>
			<li>Reduce the resolution or the number of colors of the picture.
			</li>
			<li>Change to the video card with more video memory. </li>
			<li>Reduce the value in [Max resolution of texture] in [Preview] page 
			of menu [File] [Configuration]. </li>
		</ul>
		But the setting itself of mapping image is effective even if it is not shown, 
		so you do not have to worry about that according to the situation. </dd>
		<dt>A2-2. Image file for texture is not put in the appropriate folder.</dt>
		<dd>You need to put image folder in the folder selected in [Folder of mapping 
		bitmaps] in menu [File] [Configuration].</dd>
		<dt>A2-3. View Property is not checked.</dt>
		<dd>Please check in menu [View] [Show precisely] and [Show textures].</dd>

		<dt>A3. It's a specification</dt>
		<dd>Bump mapping cannot be shown in any view mode in this version. It is not reflected on the 
		result in [Rendering]. It will be possible to be supported in future.</dd>
