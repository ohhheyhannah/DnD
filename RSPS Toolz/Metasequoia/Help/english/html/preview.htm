		<p>It can show faces and texture using any of software, Direct3D, or OpenGL. This can make it easier to know the 
		shape visually.</p>
		<p>In Direct3D or OpenGL mode, various problems might occur because of trouble or the compatibility of the display 
		driver. In that case, please see <a href="qanda/qanda.htm">FAQ</a>. I recommend you to use the latest driver 
		offered by the chip board maker.</p>
		<p>The Direct3D mode is better on the most PCs because of a speed and a quality.</p>

	<h3>Software</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>This is an original render of Metasequoia. This is available for any PC. In old PCs which do not work with 
		Direct3D or OpenGL in hardware level, it displays fastest. </li>
		<li>A bump mapping isn't displayed. </li>

<div class="menu">
	<h3>Direct3D</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The video card needs to support hardware 3D rendering. Direct3D is available on the almost all PCs sold in the year 
		2012. However, with notebook computers sold in several years ago, or in the virtual environment without a support 
		for Direct3D, you may not be able to use Direct3D. </li>
		<li>Textures cannot be shown on three orthogonal views. </li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div class="menu">
	<h3>OpenGL</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Some troubles may come with the display driver contained in the graphics card (or built-in chips) except Intel/ATI/nVIDIA. 
		Please use the reliable video card authorized by major 3DCG software as much as possible. And please update 
		the driver to the latest version offered by the maker. </li>
		<li>A bump mapping isn't displayed. </li>
